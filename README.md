# ReckReckReck
Dear readers, 
This is a file for the Reckless Coding Workshop at Limestone Books in AUG 17th 2024.

Inside, there is a index.html with 3 parts of the exercises. A simple CSS file. AND a data folder with images and texts. 

below are the images credit:

I really hope you can get into code after the workshops. 

Love,
