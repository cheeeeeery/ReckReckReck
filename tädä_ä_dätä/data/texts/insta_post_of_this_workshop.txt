A secret about coding is, it can be fun. This is because it involves communication or miscommunication. You say, tell, enter, or shout stuff to a machine and they present what they think we said. It is like writing in a specific grammar for a baby creature. We search, copy and paste. Enter. Repeat. Run!

Reckless coding workshop offers a bumbling way to learn the basics of the programming languages HTML and CSS (with a little bit of JavaScript). We will be each other’s open source, look at web infrastructure as a playground, mess around with its pixels, and organize content in the most unorganized manner. Nothing will be polished; we will explore on-site coding in a folkway. All participants will walk out with a raw website on their laptops. Don’t forget to put a semicolon.
